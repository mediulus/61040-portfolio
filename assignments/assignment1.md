# Assignment 1

## Domains

**1. Managing Communication and Training as an MIT Varsity Cross Country Athlete:** As a captain and runner on MIT’s women’s varsity cross country team, I need to stay organized and communicate effectively with teammates and coaches. Our coach manages information for over 50 athletes, often using a Google Drive, which can make it difficult to find practice times, locations, and other important updates. Athletes must remember to check for updates, and coaches can struggle to respond promptly due to the volume of messages. Additionally, as a female distance runner, it’s challenging to adjust training intensity based on hormonal cycles, and resources for this are limited. This is one of the domains that I would like to solve because I see these struggles daily from myself, my coaches, and also my team mates. I also think there are some good organization tools that could target this domain. 

**2. Planning and Cooking Nutritious Meals for Myself:** I enjoy cooking and baking, especially since living off-campus. However, it’s difficult to consistently plan meals that are healthy, affordable, quick, and varied. I often fall into routines of making similar dishes and struggle to find creative recipes that support my athletic goals. Grocery shopping is also a challenge—I tend to overestimate quantities and buy too much, leading to waste. I am quite passionate about this because I think it resonates with a lot of different populations of people--not only college students, but anyone who is active or has certain physique goals and wants help navigating this world. 

**3. Coordinating Shared Purchases with Roommates:** Living in an apartment with roommates means frequently splitting costs for shared items. We usually put purchases on one person’s card and settle up later, but tracking receipts, accounting for discounts, taxes, and gift cards, and dividing costs fairly can be confusing. It’s also awkward to remind someone to pay if they forget, and manual calculations can lead to errors. I have been dealing with this domain a lot recently since moving into my apartment and even just last weekend, my roommates and I spent almost an hour trying to figure out how to split a target receipt and I think there is definitely a tool that could be effective in this area. 

**4. Staying Connected with Family While Living Far Away:** Being from Ohio and attending MIT in Boston means I’m far from my family, which can be emotionally challenging since we’re very close.

**5. Exploring New Coffee Flavors and Cafés:** I’ve loved coffee since middle school and enjoy discovering new flavors and coffee shops, especially when visiting new cities.

**6. Advancing My Artistic Skills in New Mediums:** I create colored pencil drawings for personal enjoyment and commissions. Recently, I’ve tried to learn watercolor painting, but most resources are aimed at beginners, while I’m seeking intermediate-level guidance.

**7. Finding Thoughtful Gifts for Others:** I love giving gifts but often struggle to come up with creative and meaningful ideas for friends and family.

**8. Navigating Computer Science Studies and Career Preparation:** As a computer science student, I sometimes feel overwhelmed by the process of searching for jobs and internships, and figuring out which skills to develop for different career paths.

**9. Tracking and Sharing Movie Experiences:** I enjoy watching movies but have trouble remembering which ones I’ve seen and my opinions about them. I’m also curious about my loved ones’ movie preferences and reviews.

**10. Learning About Dog Breeds and Traits:** I adore my three dogs but don’t know much about different breeds and their characteristics.

## Problem Analysis

### Selected Problems

1. Keeping up with communication and staying informed on a large team

    Explanation: Managing communication for a large varsity team is a persistent challenge. Important updates about practices, meets, and team events are often scattered across Google Drive folders, emails, and verbal announcements, making it easy to miss critical information. Coaches are overwhelmed by the volume of messages and struggle to track individual athlete progress efficiently. A centralized dashboard or notification system would streamline communication, allowing athletes and coaches to stay informed in real time, track attendance, and share highlights. This would reduce confusion, save time, and foster a more connected team environment.

2. Struggling to pick recipes that are healthy and have good micro/macro nutrients for goals

    Explanation: With the rise of health trends and conflicting nutrition advice, it’s increasingly difficult to find recipes that align with specific fitness and wellness goals. Many resources are either too generic or not tailored to individual needs, leading to repetitive meal choices and uncertainty about nutritional value. A solution that recommends recipes based on personal goals, dietary restrictions, and activity level would empower users to make informed decisions, promote balanced eating habits, and reduce the stress of meal planning. This addresses a widespread need among students, athletes, and anyone seeking a healthier lifestyle.

3. Takes time counting up every item on a receipt and then also doing the calculations

    Explanation: Splitting shared purchases among roommates is often tedious and error-prone. Manually sorting items, accounting for discounts and taxes, and calculating each person’s share can take significant time and lead to mistakes or awkward reminders. An automated tool that scans receipts, categorizes items, and calculates totals would simplify the process, ensure fairness, and improve roommate relationships. Given how common this scenario is, a robust solution would benefit a broad audience and fill a gap not fully addressed by existing apps.

### Non-Selected Problems

1. Navigating training around your cycle as a female athlete

    Explanation: While important, this problem requires specialized knowledge in sports science and endocrinology. Developing an effective solution would be ambitious and outside my current expertise.

2. Keeping organized throughout a team

    Explanation: Organization is less of an issue than communication. Improving how information is shared and accessed would address the core challenge.

3. Lack of knowledge around cooking for beginners

    Explanation: There are already many resources available (cookbooks, social media, blogs) that effectively support beginner cooks.

4. Not knowing how much food to buy for meal prep

    Explanation: This issue can be resolved through experience and adjusting over time. It’s also highly dependent on individual habits and store options.

5. Navigating which roommate should fund a single purchase

    Explanation: This can be solved with simple communication or existing payment apps. It doesn’t present a unique technical challenge.

6. Struggle splitting math on a receipt

    Explanation: The main difficulty is organizing items by person, not the math itself. This can be addressed within the broader problem of automating receipt


## Stakeholders

1. Keeping up with communication and staying informed on a large team

    1. Athletes (primary users): Need timely, accurate logistics; fewer missed updates.
    2. Coaches/staff (primary/admin): Need scalable announcements, availability tracking, attendance data.
    3. Athletic trainers/ops (secondary): Need injury notes, facility changes, transport timing synced.

    Impact: Late or missed info wastes practice time, creates confusion, increases coach DM load; a hub reduces errors and improves preparedness.

2. Struggling to pick recipes that are healthy and have good micro/macro nutrients for goals

    1. Fitness Enthusiasts & Athletes (primary): Need macro-aware meals that fit training/recovery.
    2. Everyday Health-Conscious Individuals (primary): Want simple, balanced recipes to support wellness and reduce stress around food choices.
    3. Nutrition Professionals (secondary): Benefit from tools that provide reliable, customizable meal plans for diverse clients.

    Impact: Without good options, athletes risk poor fueling, while everyday people may default to less nutritious foods or waste ingredients. Professionals need accurate, flexible tools to guide clients efficiently.
   
3. Takes time counting up every item on a receipt and then also doing the calculations

    1. Roommates/Shared Households (primary): Frequently need to divide grocery and household costs fairly.
    2. Friends/Peers Dining Out or Shopping Together (primary): Want quick, accurate bill-splitting without manual math or awkwardness.
    3. Payment/Expense Apps (secondary): Could integrate with better itemized-splitting features, improving user satisfaction and retention.
    
    Impact: Manual splitting wastes time, creates errors, and causes awkward social dynamics. A streamlined solution benefits anyone who shares expenses, not just roommates.

## Evidence

1. Keeping up with communication and staying informed on a large team

    1. Communication is fundamental in sports. This quotes, "almost every aspect of communication appears in one way or another in sporting events or in sport themselves," showing its pervasive importance in team settings. [citation](https://scholarcommons.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=crt&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    2. Poor communication hurts coach–athlete relationships. Ineffective communication styles reduce athlete satisfaction and team success. [citation](https://aassjournal.com/article-1-1266-en.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

    5. Macro tracking is confusing and time-consuming. Nutrition experts note logging every meal detail requires extreme vigilance. [citation](https://www.precisionnutrition.com/should-you-track-your-macros?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    6. Tracking macros can impair social life. Daily logging is burdensome and makes dining out or traveling stressful. [citation](https://healthystepsnutrition.com/counting-macros-or-building-habits/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    7. Restrictive tracking may reduce variety or normalize unhealthy habits. Studies warn it can decrease nutrient diversity and promote obsessive behaviors. [citation](https://lilynicholsrdn.com/downside-of-tracking-macronutrients/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    8. Food journaling apps vary in accuracy. A study comparing MyFitnessPal, Lose It, FatSecret, and Cronometer found inconsistent macro data and missing details. [citation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08376?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    9. A comparable is AI meal planners. New tools can generate adaptive recipes based on preferences and health conditions, but most remain prototypes with limited adoption. [citation](https://formative.jmir.org/2023/1/e46434?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    10. Another comparable is Eat This Much, an automated meal planner. While powerful, reviews report oversized shopping lists and impractical meals for daily life. [citation](https://www.eatthismuch.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
   
3. Takes time counting up every item on a receipt and then also doing the calculations

    1. Splitting bills is socially awkward. Research and blogs note people often overpay or avoid asking for fair shares to reduce conflict. [citation](https://blog.billeasy.in/the-awkwardness-of-splitting-the-bill-equally-f2c6b0b74c1d)
    2. Bill splitting can create inefficiencies. A formal study found shared bills change consumption patterns and lead to wasteful choices. [citation](https://rady.ucsd.edu/_files/faculty-research/uri-gneezy/splitting-bill.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    3. Payment etiquette matters. PayPal highlights how money talk is sensitive and awkward—digital tools can reduce tension. [citation](https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2022-07-21-Bill-Splitting-Doesnt-Need-to-Be-Awkward?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    4. Poorly handled bills cause roommate conflict. Property management blogs emphasize that unclear cost-sharing quickly creates resentment. [citation](https://www.baymgmtgroup.com/blog/how-to-split-bills-with-roommates/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    5. Many people still default to spreadsheets. In the absence of better tools, households rely on Excel or one “designated splitter,” showing inefficiency. [citation](https://medium.com/stormy-jackson/bill-splitting-design-exercise-da6a959c706c)
    6. Equal splits often aren’t fair. Renters’ financial guides note that evenly dividing costs ignores differences in use or consumption. [citation](https://renter.joinroost.com/money-articles-tips-and/how-to-split-expenses-with-roommates/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    7. Itemization and fairness are computationally hard. A CS blog explains that splitting costs optimally is NP-complete, so most solutions rely on approximations. [citation](https://luckytoilet.wordpress.com/2014/04/05/splitting-utility-costs-between-roommates-is-np-complete/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    8. Group grocery shopping raises similar problems. UX research on Instacart shows that friends and roommates often abandon shared orders because bills are hard to split. [citation](https://uxdesign.cc/kp-instacart-e74e0e20c10)
    9. A comparable is Splitwise, a popular expense-sharing app. It supports group bills but locks receipt-scanning behind premium, leaving many users underserved. [citation](https://www.splitwise.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    10. Another comparable is Venmo. While widely used for payments, it doesn’t support itemized receipts, requiring manual math outside the app. [citation](https://venmo.com/home/)
    

## Features
1. Keeping up with communication and staying informed on a large team

    1. Integrated Calendar Hub: A centralized calendar that syncs all practices, meets, and updates in one place. Athletes can easily check logistics, and coaches don’t have to resend reminders across different platforms. This reduces missed updates and helps athletes plan around schedules.
    2. Athlete Performance Dashboard: Athletes log training, attendance, and wellness notes, which coaches can view in a summarized dashboard. Coaches save time tracking progress across the team, and athletes receive more tailored feedback. Trainers also benefit from seeing patterns in workload and injuries.
    3. Notifications & Alerts: Automatic push/email reminders for changes, upcoming meets, or last-minute updates. Athletes avoid missing crucial details, and coaches reduce the volume of one-off clarifying messages. Notifications can be targeted to specific groups (e.g., travel squad).

2. Struggling to pick recipes that are healthy and have good micro/macro nutrients for goals

    1. Goal-Based Recipe Recommendations: Users input goals (muscle gain, endurance, weight maintenance, wellness), and the app suggests recipes tailored to macro and micronutrient needs. This helps both athletes and everyday users find meals that fit their personal targets.
    2. Verified Nutrition Database Integration: Recipes are linked to a trusted nutrition database (e.g., USDA, Cronometer-style), ensuring accurate nutrient information. This prevents misleading macros from user-generated entries and supports nutrition professionals recommending recipes with confidence.
    3. Smart Grocery List Generator: Recipes are combined into an optimized shopping list that reduces ingredient overlap and flags perishable items. This helps everyday users save money, reduces waste, and allows athletes to keep consistent fueling across the week.
   
3. Takes time counting up every item on a receipt and then also doing the calculations

    1. Receipt Scanner & Auto-Split: Users take a photo of a receipt, and the system uses OCR to detect items, prices, and taxes. It automatically divides the receipt into selectable items, saving groups from tedious manual entry.
    2. Item Assignment with Group Linking: Each item can be tagged to one or more people in the group. The app calculates totals (including shared items) instantly. This ensures fairness for roommates, friends dining out, or group grocery runs.
    3. Discount & Gift Card Allocation: The app handles discounts, coupons, and gift cards by proportionally applying them to relevant items. This ensures transparent fairness and avoids disputes when splitting group expenses.
